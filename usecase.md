This is a doc to help design the architecture of the project by outlining specific use cases and how they would be handled.

## Basic File Storage

A user wants to store a large file. The go on the website and drag and drop the file into the upload area. There is a progress bar, maybe first its cached on the server before its uploaded to the storage devices, it can then notify the user it is safe to delete the original file.

On the server front end the user can now see a list of all files, it will be there with whatever metadata went with it.
